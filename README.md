FinalQ™ is an early-stage framework designed for automating the batch generation of template-based reports.
The goal is to provide a way to define pipelines that load data, apply parameterization, and produce multiple structured outputs (for example, PowerPoint presentations) in a reproducible, local environment without relying on external platforms.

The framework aims to serve as an extensible foundation for repetitive reporting workflows, emphasizing simplicity, control, and consistency.
